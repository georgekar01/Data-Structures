The purpose of the 2nd assignment is to become familiar with sorting algorithms and with the use of a priority queue, one of the most fundamental data structures in algorithm design. The assignment concerns problems that, among other things, are encountered in applications for operating systems and scheduling problems (job scheduling).

Suppose we have a system with M processors, in which we want to schedule processes. For example, assume that N processes have arrived and, for each i = 1, ..., N, process i requires a processing time equal to pi, the same across all processors. We want to assign each process to some processor, with the ultimate goal of completing the execution of all processes in the shortest possible time. Each process will be executed exclusively on one processor
